In the category of Empirical Evaluation (category 2), we focus on the application area of Food
and Wellness. Our proposed machine learning algorithm streamlines meal planning by
customizing recipes based on individual dietary preferences, health goals, and restrictions.
Tailored for university students and those with dietary limitations, the system addresses
environmental concerns by minimizing food waste through diverse alternatives and substitutes,
maximizing ingredient use. Economically, it aids individuals with time constraints, particularly
budget-conscious students, offering cost-effective and time-efficient meal options. In summary,
the system promotes inclusivity, encourages healthier choices, reduces food waste, and provides
economical, time-saving meal solutions.
